- [Light propagation and magnon-photon coupling in optically dispersive magnetic media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05851):  
Dispersive magneto-optical effect is considered, and EM field is quantised phenomenologically. Magnetisation precession is written in terms of a magnon, which is coupled with photons. The coupling strength is enhanced at the epsilon near zero frequency.
