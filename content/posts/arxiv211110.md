今日はなんとなく英語でメモった．
メタサーフェスと2D物質の組み合わせでfunctionalityを出す系の研究が実験できるようになっていてすごい．
Cherenkov放射の計算をするのにeffective mediumとしてstrong fieldを取り扱うのに注意が必要だよ！という話は自分も気になっていたところで同様のことを考える人がいるもんだなあウンウンという気持ちになった．

### physics
- [Comment on Cherenkov radiation in magnetized vacuum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05119):  
Although high-intensity magnetostatic field gives an effective refractive index to vacuum, there will not be Čerenkov radiation due to a quantum kinematic rule. Instead of considering the effective index in vacuum, they analysed the quantum kinematics of an electron travelling in strong magnetic field w/ Landau quantisation to show the statement above.
- [Spintronic emitters for super-resolution in THz-spectral imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05023):  
Illuminating a heterostructure hosting spin currents with femto-sec. laser, they produced near-field THz radiation. It is utilised for scanning microscopy to achieve super-resolution🔍💥
- [Stimulated Brillouin scattering in chiral photonic crystal fiber](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05289):  
Twisted photonic crystal fibre can support the stable propagation of circularly-polarised light🌀 If the intensity of the guided light is high enough, the stimulated Brillouin scattering is triggered. The backscattered light has the opposite polarisation and a lower frequency. Since it is a stimulated process, the backscattered light is coherent and can be used as a laser source.
