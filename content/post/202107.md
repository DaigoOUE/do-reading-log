  - smith purcell effect: cerenkov type radiation from the swift charge near a grating 
  - cerenkov:
  Tamm and Frank studied the radiation from a charged particle traveling at a constant velocity, 
  which is also known as Tamm problem.
  They found the radiation power by integrating the Poynting vector over a cylinder enclosing the particle trajectory.
  They show the radiation power per travel length is given by  
  "Frank Tamm formula".  
  where we can find the power become finite if and only if the particle velocity exceeds the speed of light.
  In our case,
  we can calculate the radiation intensity (power per unit area) by integrating the Poynting vector over two surfaces above and below the modulated boundary,
  We can find that the radiation power become finite if and only if the grating velocity exceed that of light.
  This is consistent with the Frank Tamm formula.
  - "temporal Fourier transform"
  - see [this paper](https://www.osapublishing.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-59-35-11146) for the derivation of frank tamm formula, cerenkov radiation and smith purcell radiation.
