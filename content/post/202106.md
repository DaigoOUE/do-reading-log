  - cover letter
  - justification
  - manuscript
- PhD thesis
  - abstract
  - outline
    - [x] part 1
    - [ ] part 2
  - thin film
    - simultaneously solve the transfer matrix equations at upper and lower interfaces
  - consider the mode density in order to take the finite system size into consideration
  - Lifshitz formula <=> Casimir sum
    - when we can calculate the dispersion relation it is convenient to use the Casimir sum
    - on the other hand, in many cases, we cannot obtain the explicitly expression of the dispersion but can compute the scattering matrix,
